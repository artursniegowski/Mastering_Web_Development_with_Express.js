Level 6 - using OAuth 2.0 - it is basicaly using a third party
	service for authentication, we can use Facebook, or Google,
	to do the hard work for us bc they have more resources,
	so the user has to be authenticated in their service and allow
	to use their authnetication in our app, this why we need to create an
	app that gives us this possibility. on our databse we just save
	an id of the user to identify if the user was alredy authenticated.
