# 08_Blog_Website_MongoDB

This project picks up where the 05_Blog_Website project left off.
The functionality was extended by adding the storage of the blog data (Posts) in a NoSQL database - MongoDB and managing it with the use of mongoose-js. The main page includes the the snippets (up to 100 characters long) of posts, and each of the posts will have a "read more" link that can redirect the user to the post detail view with the full text where you can read them independently. This redirection is based on the posts id, which will be fetched from MongoDB at the time of requesting it. The hidden route '/compose' that is used for creating posts, will perform a read operation on the database with the newly created post. Everything is generated using EJS partials. The website is fully mobile-responsive. It was developed with Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB and mongoose on the backend and CSS and Bootstrap 5.3 on the frontend.Â
